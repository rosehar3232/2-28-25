# let's next write a program that converts 
# feet and inches to meters 
print("I will ask for 2 numbers: your feet first, and then inches second. So, if yo are 5 foot 4 inches, please answer 5 first, and then 4 second.")
# 1 foot = 0.3048 meters
feet = int(input("How many feet tall are you? "))
# 1 inch = 0.0254 meters
inches = int(input("... and how many inches? "))
# note: the conversion rates are "HARD-CODED"
meters = (feet * 0.3048) + (inches * 0.0254)
print("You are " + str(meters)+ "meters tall.")
